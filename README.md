# Data_Analysis_Project
Running a successful restaurant means more than just making tasty food. It is about
understanding what customers like, keeping up with trends, and making sure things run
smoothly. Analyzing sales data is crucial for restaurant owners and managers to make smart
decisions and improve how the restaurant operates.
In the restaurant business, success comes from adapting to change and knowing what customers
want. Restaurant analysis is all about looking at various aspects of a restaurant's performance,
like how much money it makes, what customers like, and how well things are running. This
helps us to make better decisions and overall improves the restaurant's success.
In the ever-evolving restaurant business, embracing innovation is key to standing out. This
involves not only experimenting with new menu items but also adopting technology for
smoother operations, whether through online ordering systems or streamlined payment
processes. The ability to blend tradition with modernity contributes to the restaurant's appeal and
keeps it relevant to a diverse customer base.

This analysis will answer the following research questions.
Research questions:
 Can we identify the peak hours during which the restaurant experiences the highest sales,
and how do sales vary during these peak hours?
 How do sales differ between Fast-food and Beverages categories, and are there specific
times or days when one category outperforms the other?
 Does the customer's gender impact sales?
 Analyzing to find out whether there is any linear relationship between item price,
quantity and received by.
